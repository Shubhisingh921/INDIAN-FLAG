# Indian National Flag Using Python üó≥Ô∏è

We are going to Draw The Great Indian Flag using Python Turtle. Well, this flag is drawn using the python turtle module. As it provides the inbuilt methods that make our task of drawing the picture easily. The number of coding lines is not very long as we have made use of loops to lessen the repetition of the lines of code.

The Indian flag code is simple and easily understandable for the ones who have just begun to learn python and the turtle module. We have also provided the comments in each section for easy understanding.
